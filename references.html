	<p><span class="body">To whom it may concern:</span></p>
	<p><span class="body">I have the pleasure of working with Roger on several branding and collateral projects at Learning Sciences over the last two years and have always been impressed with his creative work. Not only has Roger always delivered his designs within a given timeframe or earlier, but he also always impressed me with his design solutions and creative problem-solving. Roger has been open to feedback and redesign requests when needed (which is not often), has an open line for communication, and cares about the end product being of the highest quality. I highly recommend Roger for any graphic design project.</span></p>

	<p><span class="body">To whom it may concern:</span></p>
	<p><span class="body">I’m writing to recommend Roger Schinkler as a tremendously talented Art Director.</span></p>
	<p><span class="body">Roger and I worked together at Airport Experience News (formerly Airport Revenue News) for more than 14 years. Among his many responsibilities was designing the print magazine, which is published 11 times a year. Each month he made the magazine look incredible. His talent was particularly noteworthy when I would submit a story for layout with very little art and less inspiration. No matter what the topic, Roger found a way to compellingly illustrate and design the article.</span></p>
	<p><span class="body">We are a small team at AXN. Schedules are tight and the workload can be overwhelming. Roger always came through with fantastic designs completed on deadline.</span></p>
	<p><span class="body">I’m happy to discuss further by phone or email.</span></p>

	<p><span class="body">To whom it may concern:</span></p>
	<p><span class="body">I am writing this letter to recommend Roger Schinkler for a position within your company. Roger is an artist with a keen eye for arranging all the elements, such as color, images, and type, that are necessary to produce striking design be it in an ad, in the pages of a publication or on our website. Additionally, he is meticulous and orderly in his process and is always current on design trends. </span></p>
	<p><span class="body">For the last fifteen years Roger and I worked together at Airport Experience News, formerly Airport Revenue News, where he held the title of Director of Creative Services. In the most recent five years I have served as publisher of the business unit. During that time, I have challenged Roger to become even more bold and striking in his design. He responded by exceeding expectations. Additionally, Roger is responsible for establishing and maintaining the look and themes of all our collateral materials, websites and publications. When I decided to re-brand the company, Roger created a more contemporary identity package complete with logo, color schemes and a guideline for each of their use. The new look has resonated within the airport experience industry. </span></p>
	<p><span class="body">In all, Roger is a diligent worker and a loyal teammate. The sum of his training, experience and skills make Roger a valued addition to any team. I can comfortably say that Airport Experience News has benefited tremendously from his talents. </span></p>
	<p><span class="body">Please feel free to contact me if you have any other questions. </span></p>

	<p><span class="body">To whom it may concern:</span></p>
	<p><span class="body">This letter is to endorse the qualities, talent and skill sets of Roger Schinkler, who worked for me for nearly 10 years.  I was the founder and CEO of Airport Revenue News (currently Airport Experience News) and hired Roger as Creative Services Director.</span></p>
	<p><span class="body">Roger is a talented, gifted artist. He has an inherent design sense, creating a page or a piece of artwork with an intuitive vision and a passion to achieve it, no matter how intricate or complex.  In fact he truly loves a creative challenge.  When he designed a magazine cover or artwork for a feature story he was thoughtful about how to exemplify its essence.  The outcome was always a clever, creative depiction with beauty, style and grace even under the pressure of deadlines.</span></p>
	<p><span class="body">I highly recommend Roger without reservation for any design or creative position. He is a loyal, reliable, independent, valuable team member.  He works well with others and endears himself to those around him. He is serious about his work yet knows how to have fun and is a well-rounded, intelligent person. Any company will be lucky to have Roger on their team.</span></p>
	<p><span class="body">If you require further information about Roger’s professional skills feel free to contact me at the email or mobile number.</span></p>

	<p><span class="body">To whom it may concern:</span></p>
	<p><span class="body">I would like to take this opportunity to provide a little insight regarding Roger Schinkler. I have known Roger professionally for the last fourteen years in the capacity of Director of Creative Services at Airport Revenue News, and have worked with him directly on the their Annual Conference over that same time frame. Roger is an extremely creative person who can look at the end game and find a creative and professional path to successfully achieving the desired goal. His attention to detail is second to none, and there is never a "T" that is not crossed, or an "I" that is undotted. He consistently delivered a terrific product while keeping deadlines in mind.</span></p>
	<p><span class="body">Roger will be a great asset to any company, and 1 strongly endorse Roger and his ability.</span></p>
	<p><span class="body">Best regards,<br>Paul<br></span></p>
